                <p>Air squats, also known as bodyweight squats, are commonly used in training programs. They are only done using your own body weight, while regular squats may use additional weights instead. You should feel the squat in your thighs and in your glutes.</p>

            <h2>Deadlift</h2>

                <p>Deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum), such as weights lying on the ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises in which all repetitions begin with dead weight. In most other lifts there is an eccentric (lowering of the weight) phase followed by the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. During these exercises, a small amount of energy is stored in the stretched muscles and tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is not flexible beyond the range of motion.
                    There are several positions one can approach when performing the deadlift, which include the conventional deadlift, squat, and sumo-deadlift.
                    Although this exercise uses the hips and legs as the primary movers, it can just as easily be considered a back exercise.</p>

                <p>Front Squats are similar to Back Squats, however the barbell is placed across the front side of your shoulders instead of your upper back. This shifts the center of mass forward, which allows for a more upright posture, making it a spine-friendly lift. It also shifts some of the work from your glutes to your quads, making this one of the most effective quad strength and size builders.</p>

                <p> Perform a clean using a weighted medicine ball. Great for learning the technique for the barbell clean, especially the difficult straight-arm shrug.</p>

                <p>The overhead squat is the ultimate core exercise, the heart of the snatch, and peerless in developing effective athletic movement. This functional gem trains for efficient transfer of energy from large to small body parts - the essence of sport movement. For this reason it is an indispensable tool for developing speed and power. The overhead squat also demands and develops functional flexibility, and similarly develops the squat by amplifying and cruelly punishing faults in squat posture, movement, and stability.</p>

            <h2>Push Jerk</h2>
            <img src=".\images\push-jerk.jpg" alt="This is what a Push Jerk looks like!">
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-hKuAfWNUw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>A Push Jerk is a progression of the push press in which a forceful hip drive coupled with a drop under the bar--a catch--is used to aid in getting the load overhead.
                    When done properly, the bar moves in a perfectly vertical plane only, which is the most efficient path. To do this, one must move the head back to make room for the bar, then replace the head to the normal position after the bar passes by. The lift is complete when the arms are locked out overhead, with the head "through the window", and the feet are reset into the jump stance (directly under the hips). Finally, some other key points to address is the importance of having active shoulders, and a small dip to facilitate the drive of the load upwards. The drop under the bar makes it so the load doesn't have to travel as far to make the catch easier. Note that the dip is not so low as to be a front squat, which takes away the stretch that helps drive the force up enough to pull underneath it during the catch. It is also common to "jump" the legs from hip width into a squat stance, where the hips are about shoulder width apart.</p>

            <h2>Push Press</h2>

                <p>The push press is similar to the shoulder press; however, the movement is started by a 'push' from the legs. This begins the momentum of the movement, the weight is then slowly lowered back to the chest or dropped from overhead. It can also be used from behind the neck. Behind the neck push presses are not recommended though due to an increased risk of injury.</p>

            <h2>Shoulder Press</h2>

                <p>The shoulder press is the best way to bulk up and tone your shoulders. The shoulder press, or Overhead / Military Press, as it is also known, also works your traps and triceps. You can use barbells, dumbbells, or use your body weight as part of a cardio workout. With weights, keep them in front of you for this exercise, donâ€™t lift them behind your head. This exercise specifically focuses on the anterior portion of your shoulders.</p>

            <h2>Sumo Deadlift High Pull</h2>
            <img src=".\images\sumodeadlift.jpg" alt="This is what a Sumo Deadlift High Pull looks like!">

                <p>The sumo deadlift high pull is a great power developer. The lift starts much like the deadlift, but with a wider stance and narrow grip. The weight is accelerated using your legs and hips to drive it to a top position directly under your chin. This movement is fast and moves the weight a long distance, therefore making the power output very high.</p>
